# CPlusPlusRepo
A place where I describe how code works with the C++ Programming language.

Hello and welcome to this simple guide on how to get started with programming in C++. By now, if you have read my first repository, please check that out. I assume you already have your IDE ready. I also assume you know how to at least write a Hello World program as well (again, check the first repo to learn how to do so). 

## Data Types
Like with most programming langauges, C++ has a variety of data types that users will need to write their programs in. Here's some basics that you may need.

**int**: Allows users to store whole numbers (integers) on the program (such as 1,2,3, etc.)

**double**: Allows users to store decimal numbers (such as 12.25)

**float**: Similar to double, it can hold decimal numbers. Though the float uses less memory and can hold a 32-bit number instead of 64-bit.

**char**: Allows users to store characters such as 'a', 'b', etc. Note that '2' (in char) does not equal the actual number 2.
