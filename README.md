# CPlusPlusRepo
A place where I describe how code works with the C++ Programming language.

Hello and welcome to this simple guide on how to get started with programming in C++. By now, if you have read my first repository, please check that out. I assume you already have your IDE ready. I also assume you know how to at least write a Hello World program as well (again, check the first repo to learn how to do so). This repo is to make concepts and programs as easy as possible to understand. For more in depth information and explainations, check out the following books linked below. 

## Data Types
Like with most programming langauges, C++ has a variety of data types that users will need to write their programs in. Here's some basics that you may need.

**int**: Allows users to store whole numbers (integers) on the program (such as 1,2,3, etc.).

**double**: Allows users to store decimal numbers (such as 12.25 for example).

**float**: Similar to double, it can hold decimal numbers. Though the float uses less memory and can hold a 32-bit number instead of 64-bit.

**char**: Allows users to store characters such as 'a', 'b', etc. Note that '2' (in char) does not equal the actual number 2.

**arrays**: An array is a list of elements that begin at 0 and go to MAX - 1. For instance, if you're given an array that carries 5 ints, then the places of that array are labeled as 0-4. Arrays with characters are also known as **strings**.

## Conditionals
Conditional statements are useful when it comes to determining the right outcome of one's program. The most popular ones are the if and switch statements. 

**if or if else**: Follows a format where if the condition is met or is true (in the parenthesis), then you execute the code. If it is not met or false, then you don't execute the code within that if statement and carry on with your program. Additionally, if there are multiple cases, then **else if** exists so that if the first one is not true, then go to the else if.

**switch**: A switch statement is similar to the if statement, however has multiple cases for the program to go through. If that is met, you would need to break from that switch statement. 

## Looping
Loops are an important tool to use when writing programs, as you may need to repeat certain actions for a certain or unknown timeframe.

**for loops**: For loops allow users to start at a certain index, the conditional (where the index is less than a certain number for example), and the incrementor or decementor. This is useful if you want to repeat actions on your code for a certain amount of times. 

**while loops**: Unlike for loops, while loops only require the conditional as a parameter. This is needed if you're going to execute certain instructions for an unknown amount of times. Typically, you would declare your index out side of the loop and your incrementor or decrementor inside of the loop.

There are certain times where nested loops are needed, which is essentially a loop inside of a loop.

In this repo, I've provided some basic programs that allows you to get to know how to program with the C++ Programming Language.
